# NASM Assembly Project

A Codepsaces template for building, running, and debugging projects in
NASM assembly and C.

Intended for a course in *Computer Organization*, this template includes a
task for building an assembly file project potentially using a mix of NASM
assembly and C. When building a project, all assembly and C source files are
assembled/compiled seperately, then are linked with the C library to build
the executable.
